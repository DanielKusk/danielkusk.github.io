## Projects
* Time Series Forecasting of the ACN EV Charging Datasets (Bachelor's thesis)
  * Prediction of charging patterns for electric vehicles on a user and location level based on time series data from California charging stations. The predictions were made using the machine learning methods of Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. 
  * [Report](/Reports/P6.pdf)

* Data Analysis using Machine Learning
  * Optimization of the product development process and product time-to-market for an external partner (manufacturing company). This was achieved by making predictions and optimization based on a dataset from the company using the machine learning methods of linear regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest.

* Property Suggester for Wikidata using Association Rule Mining. 
  * Collaboration with Wikimedia on improving the completeness of the Wikidata database using graph theory and the machine learning method Association Rule Mining. The project resulted in a tool which identified missing info in the database. This info could the be found and filled in by their volunteer contributors. 
  * [Report](/Reports/P4.pdf)

* Interaction with and visualization of structured data
  *  Predictive maintenance framework for an external partner’s products in an attempt to save reparations and breakdowns. This was achieved using different visualizations and identifying patterns that led to breakdowns in operations data from the company’s products.

* Verification of statistical methods by simulation
  *  Investigation of pitfalls and assumptions of statistical methods using simulated data. 
  *  [Report](/Reports/P2.pdf)

* Value estimation of soccer players using Big Data
  *  Testing the value estimation of soccer players in the video game FIFA 20 using correlation and regression analysis on a dataset with player attributes and monetary estimations. 
  *  [Report](/Reports/P1.pdf)

* What makes a great wine?
  *  Identification of factors that yield a good review of wines using correlation and regression analyses on a wine review dataset.
  *  [Report](/Reports/P0.pdf)
